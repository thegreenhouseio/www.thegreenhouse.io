## Hello, I'm **Owen Buckley**! ðŸ‘‹

I find myself most passionate about helping people learn more about technology and how to improve their process and workflows.  I like to do so through software projects that are well designed, tested, performant, and maintained in a way that advocates for both user _and_ developer experiences.  My broad range 
of technical knowledge and capabilities, creativity, interpersonal skills, and a good splash of entrepreneurial spirit make me a valuable contributor to any project.

**The Greenhouse** is my platform for growing and building ideas, projects, and businesses with pragmatic technology solutions leveraging some of the best tools available today. Projects are designed and developed to be performant and maintainable, automated in their delivery (CI / CD) and most importantly, enable great user experiences (UX).  To see what we're up to, you can see some of our open source projects in our [GitHub](https://github.com/thegreenhouseio)

I'm always up to something online be it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/thegreenhouseio) [Medium](https://medium.com/@thegreenhouseio), or around the local [Rhode Island Tech Meetup Community](https://www.pvdgeeks.org), so I hope to hear from you!
