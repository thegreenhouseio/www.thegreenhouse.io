## Hello, I'm **Owen Buckley**! ðŸ‘‹

I find myself most passionate about helping people learn more about technology and how to improve their process and workflows.  I like to do so through software projects that are well designed, tested, performant, and maintained in a way that advocates for both user _and_ developer experiences.  My broad range of technical knowledge and capabilities, creativity, interpersonal skills, and a good splash of entrepreneurial spirit make me a valuable contributor to any project.

**The Greenhouse** is a personal business of my own with the goal of helping local entrepreneurs and small businesses plan out their ideas and strategies while helping make technology their new competitive advantage.  Be it small business consultation, advice on creating a blog or content based website, coding help or mentorship, presentation or speaking opportunities, business or product development, and everything in between, I am there and ready to answer questions and help solve any technical problems or questions you have!

I'm always up to something online be it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/thegreenhouseio) [Medium](https://medium.com/@thegreenhouseio), or around the local [Rhode Island Tech Meetup Community](https://www.pvdgeeks.org), so I hope to hear from you!
