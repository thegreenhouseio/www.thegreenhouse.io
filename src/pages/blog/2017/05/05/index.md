The Greenhouse is pleased to announce <a href="https://github.com/thescientist13/github-dashboard/releases/tag/1.2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://github.com/thescientist13/github-dashboard/releases/tag/1.2.0');">a new release of GitHub Dashboard</a>! Now displaying organization or username before a repository name, as well as an icon indicator if a repository is a fork.  On a technical note, a couple console warnings while running unit tests were fixed.
