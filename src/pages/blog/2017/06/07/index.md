Just wanted to share a new OSS project I just put out over the weekend; <a href="https://github.com/thegreenhouseio/php-api-seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://github.com/thegreenhouseio/php-api-seed');">php-api-seed</a>.  It&apos;s a RESTful API backend written in PHP that powers some of my personal sites, like <a href="https://www.analogstudios.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://www.analogstudios.net');">Analog Studios.</a>  It uses **Slim** as the micro-framework, JWT for authentication, and can be deployed as a phar.
    
It definitely has some room for some refactoring improvements, and I&apos;m always open to feedback, in particular around security.
