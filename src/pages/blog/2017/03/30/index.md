Since not all existing AngularJS (1.x) projects can jump into using Angular (2+) and <i>ng-upgrade</i> may not be a feasible option for some, I created <a href="https://github.com/thegreenhouseio/angularjs-webpack-seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://github.com/thegreenhouseio/angularjs-webpack-seed');">a seed repo in GitHub to demonstrate AngularJS working with webpack and ES2015+ syntax.</a>

To me, ES2015+ syntax, in particular the introduction of modules (`import` / `export`) has ushered in a new era of writing JavaScript applications, including our good friend AngularJS.
            
By adopting ES2015+ syntax and following meaningful styleguide conventions like John Papa&apos;s, these effort can really go a long way to improving the readability and organization of an existing AngularJS app.  Plus, if you can slowly migrate through the releases of AngularJS &gt; 1.5, you can set yourself up for a migration path to Angular now.

This seed is not meant to be comprehensive, but just as a way to show that any existing AngularJS app can benefit from an ES2015+ upgrade, backed by webpack.

Hope to hear your thoughts and feedback!
