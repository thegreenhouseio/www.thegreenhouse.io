          <p>From my own personal experience, I can say getting involved in open source has certainly helped me mature multiple multiple aspects of my professional and personal life.  It was for this
            reason that as my job responsibilities started to include helping mentoring and training junior developers, I would often use open source as a good jumping off point for getting 
            involved in software development.  Although <i>I</i> knew where to look, for someone new to their respective community and not familiar with all the tools and languages or even GitHub itself, 
            I realized there was a way to help make a difference.
          </p>

          <p><OutboundLink target="_blank" href="">Contributary</OutboundLink> is a new project I have started with the goal of helping connect open source projects with the 
            open source community by providing a webapp and general tools to make searching out and contributing to open source projects easier and more intuitive.  
          </p>

          <p>Contributary has only just recently launched in an early release phase and is eager to look for its own set of contributors.  The project 
            is <OutboundLink target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ContributaryCommunity">open source</OutboundLink> so you can use Contributary to find ways to contribute to Contributary (much meta)! ðŸ¤“</p>
