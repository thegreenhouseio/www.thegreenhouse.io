Made this a little while ago but felt it would be fun to share, called <a href="https://github.com/thescientist13/git-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://github.com/thescientist13/git-explorer');"><b>Git Explorer</b>.</a>

It is a NodeJS package you can install from NPM that will provide a nice browser based comparison tool for any `git` repo on your local machine.
